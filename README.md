A drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction system using machine learning is a valuable tool in the field of pharmacology and healthcare. 
Drug-drug interactions occur when two or more drugs interact with each other in a way that affects their efficacy or safety when taken together. 
These interactions can lead to adverse effects or reduce the effectiveness of one or more drugs. Predicting and managing DDIs is crucial to ensure patient safety and optimize drug therapy.
Here's an overview of how a DDI prediction system using machine learning works:
Data Collection
Feature Extraction
Data Preprocessing
Machine Learning Model Selection
Model Training
Evaluation 
Model Optimization
Deployment
Monitoring and Updates
